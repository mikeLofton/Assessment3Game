## How to Play
Again the player's goal is to destroy all enemy ships before the enemy ship runs into the player. Once all enemy ships have been destroyed you win and have to freedom to fly around. If the player ship is hit too many times and the player lives reach to zero, game over my friend. There are two power ups to help the player acheive their goal. The power up in the top left corner decreases the player ship size and radius size to easly evade enemy ships. The second power up in the bottom right corner surrounds the player with bullets that protect the player from enemy ships. Once an enemy ship runs into the bullet the bullet will despawn and leave the player ship vulnerable so be careful.
